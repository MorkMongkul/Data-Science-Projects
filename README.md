# ðŸ§  Data Science Projects

This repository contains a collection of my data science projects that apply real-world data to solve business, social, or technical problems. Each project demonstrates the full workflowâ€”from data collection and cleaning to analysis, modeling, and interpretation.

## ðŸ“Œ What You'll Find Here

- End-to-end machine learning pipelines
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization
- Feature engineering and preprocessing techniques
- Model training and evaluation
- SQL and database design projects
- Clear documentation and code explanations

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, etc.)
- SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git/GitHub for version control
- Data visualization tools

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The goal of this repository is to showcase my practical skills in data science by solving meaningful problems, building models, and communicating insights through well-documented code and visuals.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

Each project has its own folder and includes:

- A `README.md` file describing the project
- Jupyter notebooks or scripts
- Dataset or links to data sources
- Results, plots, and insights

## ðŸ™‹ About Me

Iâ€™m an engineering student majoring in Data Science with a passion for solving problems using data and building impactful solutions.
